An event handling system aimed towards real-time applications such as GUIs and Game Engines. Drumbeat is heavily inspired by the Observer pattern and its interface is inspired by some Reactive X libraries. However, this crate intends to be aimed towards real-time applications as described before.

Why drumbeat?

The reason for the name is that a good real-time event system should be rhythmic in its operation like the beat of a drum.
